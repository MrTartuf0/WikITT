            <p>
                Adriano Olivetti was an engineer and industrialist (Ivrea 1901-Aigle, Switzerland, 1960). 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He entered the company founded by his father Camillo at a very young age - who in 1908 had started the construction of the first Italian typewriters in the Ivrea plant. 
                Adriano became general manager of the said company in 1933.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He succeeded his father as president in 1938, and, in this capacity, he provided for a radical transformation of the company's organizational structure.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Adrianoâ€™s social, welfare, cultural, and recreational initiatives were also noteworthy not only in his company but he was regarded as a progressive in the entire industry.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He often collaborated with top-notch designers involved in the modern movement so he could be able to get bigger perspectives and deliver quality work. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Adriano was also interested in politics. In 1948, he gave birth to the Community Movement, for which he was elected deputy in the third legislature of the Republic (1958). 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He also carried out a passionate and fruitful activity in the cultural field with the Community Editions.
